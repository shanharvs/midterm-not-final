    <h2>Teenage Years</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.8; font-size: 15px; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif; text-indent: 70px; margin: 30px;"> When was in teenage years, she started to notice time was moving too fast.<sup>1</sup>
             One blink, she’s finally a teenager.<sup>2</sup> 
             At those times, she started having crushes and flirts with random boys at her compound.<sup>3</sup> 
             She went with her nieces, which is around her age too, to go to them and try to get noticed by those boys.<sup>4</sup> 
             She still doesn’t like going to school and notices that she hates Mondays because it’s the first day to attend her classes.<sup>5</sup> 
             She’s a late-night crammer but still passes her quizzes and exams.<sup>6</sup>
             Her favorite subject is Araling Panlipunan, especially when the lessons are all about history.<sup>7</sup>
             She’s good at memorizing if she takes it seriously, you see.<sup>8</sup> 
             During those school days, she met her new two friends, they talked like typical teenage girls and go out to buy street foods after their class.<sup>9</sup>
             She has had a good social life before and it was thrilling. She also discovers how to read on Wattpad online.<sup>10</sup>
             And she guiltily admits that she reads books that were not suitable for her age but she loves it.<sup>11</sup>
             She still reads her sisters’ books behind their backs and imagines herself being the main love interest in those books.<sup>12</sup>
             Her and her sisters are getting along, or maybe she was a brat when she was a child which is why they were not close before.<sup>13</sup>
             And like some teenagers, she unfortunately experienced bullying.<sup>14</sup>
             She was bullied because she sat with one of the boys in her classroom and the girl thinks she likes him.<sup>15</sup>
             It was one of her most traumatic events that happened in her teenage years. Almost every classmate of hers turned their backs on her.<sup>16</sup>
             And one time, she heard one of her favorite teachers in AP call her ‘bangag’ because she has eyebags under her eyes.<sup>17</sup>
             That was the time she realized that even those you look up to are awful and that respect begets respect.<sup>18</sup>
             Those times ruined her teenage years for her.<sup>19</sup>
             Issues from her family had risen then and there.<sup>20</sup> 
             Her Dad also slowly went away and lived in Zamboanga City.<sup>21</sup>
             It was a good thing her family and some of her friends are there to support her in those years and that she graduated with honors in her junior high in <abbr title="Juan Sumulong High School">JSHS</abbr> and graduated with high honor in senior high in <abbr title= "Nazarene Catholic School">NCS</abbr> located in Quiapo, Manila.<sup>22</sup>
             She thinks, <q>her teenage years are is black and white as she experienced terrific happiness and lots of sadness.</q><sup>23</sup></p>
