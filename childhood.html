        <h2>Childhood Years</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.8; font-size: 15px; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif; text-indent: 70px; margin: 30px;"><b>Shanizza Harvey</b> loves to read books from the very beginning.<sup>1</sup> 
            In her childhood years, around ten or eleven years old, she was already reading books of her sisters which are usually stories from Wattpad. Stories like <i>Diary ng Panget, Teen Clash, and She’s Dating The Gangster</i>; the kind of stories that feels cringe reading today but feels like home every time she stumbles into it.<sup>2</sup> 
            She also likes to watch tagalog animes on TV in peaceful mornings. As a child, she wanted to be an astronaut or a ballerina because she was inspired by cartoons she’s watched.<sup>3</sup> 
            Apart from that, she also likes to go outside and do absolutely everything; playing hide and seek and tumbang preso, be a mother on chinese garter, keeping stones that are small and smooth, collecting pogs and texts.<sup>4</sup>
            At home, oh, she doesn’t like to be at home, like she thinks when going to school.<sup>5</sup>
            Her mother is a bit strict and her sisters are much old than her.<sup>6</sup>
            She’s the seventh of her sisters, you see.<sup>7</sup>
            The sister before her has a nine years age gap between them.<sup>8</sup>
            The only savior in their house is probably her Dad because he loves to spoil her that much and calls her ‘his favorite and beautiful daughter’.<sup>9</sup>
            Her father even went with her to the mall, Ever, which is located in Quezon City.<sup>10</sup>
            She loves that mall very much because of her father.<sup>11</sup>
            She also loves to go to <i>TomsWorld</i> there and try all those arcade games<sup>12</sup>
            And some other times, they will go to Puregold around Quezon City too, and buy pizza.<sup>13</sup>
            She adores it every time her father praises her that she ate almost all the pizza, which is why she tries to eat everything whenever they go there.<sup>14</sup>
            Like a typical child, she discovers she has fears too; she fears heights, falling off the stairs, spiders, and cockroaches.<sup>15</sup>
            She had experienced falling from the stairs and her dad treated her Cornetto to calm her down.<sup>16</sup>
            Honestly, if she could relive one memory in her childhood days, it’s most likely where she had fun with her Dad and his one box of pizza.<sup>17</sup>
            It really was my most fond memories of her childhood.<sup>18</sup>
            She’s a Daddy’s girl, after all.<sup>19</sup>
            She thinks, <q>her childhood is probably one of her most colorful days.</q><sup>20</sup><br></p>
